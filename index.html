        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am a first-year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am determined to pursue my degree in Business Administration. I would love to open up my own business. In specific, I would like to open up a multi-purpose hall in which events such as; banquets, weddings, quinceaneras, dance lessons, and much more could take place. I am local to the city of Riverside. I was born and raised in Riverside. Riverside has been the one and only place where I have created memories and my lifetime friends. I am a decendent of immigrant parents, whom have strived to do their best for their three kids. It is extremely important for myself to make my parents proud. My parents were both 19 year-olds in search of a better life for themselves and their future kids. They have come to this unknown country with a dream and I can not let their struggles go in vain. They are my biggest and strongest motivation to do well. I owe it all to them.<br><br>

        You will never find me indoors. I am a fun and adventurous girl. I aspire to travel the world and find out for myself the beauties and treasures that the world has to offer. As a little girl, I never traveled so my mind was naive enough to think that California was the only place that existed in the world. It was just me, myself, and I in my own little world. I want to travel to all the places in the world that I have ever studied and seen. Whom which include Brazil, Paris, Italy, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Spain, Italy, Cancun. Each one of these places have interested me to visit because of its rich history and beautiful scenery. The sun just happens to shine a little bit more at those places. My goal is to take the opportunity to study abroad in college. The thought of studying about the place where you live in sounds simply espectacular to me.
<br><br>

        Like I said before, my parents migrated to this country when they were nineteen years old in search of a better life. They migrated from Mazatlan and Culiacan, Sinaloa, where some of the most beautiful sunsets take place. They did not leave such a beautiful place because there was a war or bad politics, but instead because the opportunities to get ahead and have a better life, was in the United States. Truly though, Sinaloa is such a beautiful place. It is in my roots and in my blood. I belong to such a beautiful place because of my parents and I could not be more proud. I truly love Sinaloa and all that it has to offer. Some would say that Sinaloa is one of the most dangerous places in this world due to the cartel issues, and I agree. Yet, it is one of the most touristic places. They offer some of the most beautiful sunsets and amazing food. I love Sinaloa and I am proud that it is in my roots.
